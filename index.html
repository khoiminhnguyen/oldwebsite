        <p>The premise of this two month project began when I asked a classmate how much his Boosted Board costed. From there, the premise was simple; How could I build a Boosted Board for as cheap as possible? The first month of the project was strictly focused on budgeting and creating a list of components with most importance. The second month involved compromising on certain aspects of the board while minimizing performance losses. Currently, the longboard is a running a single motor which utilizes 80mm wheels and runs on a 3:1 gear ratio. With the 5200mAh battery installed, the board has a theoretical range of 13 miles and a top speed of 30mph.</p>

        <p> <i>Battery / Battery Management System (BMS)</i> </br>I wanted the board to not only be efficient as possible, but also make maintaining the board as simple as possible. Thus, I wanted an integrated BMS, so the board could be charged without requiring a balance charger. Originally, I planned on creating my own BMS and soldering it to two 22.2V lithium-polymer batteries connected in parallel. However, the price of the battery system alone would have taken up around $200, 66% of the current budget. Instead, I found a cheaper 36V 5200mAhlithium-ion battery with an integrated BMS and dc 2.1 connector for charging. </p>

        <p> <i>Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)</i> </br>The ESC is a prebuilt motherboard designed for single motor use and comes with built in RC control. The controller firmware cannot be altered from factory presets. Thus, this is a temporary solution before I am able to acquire an ESC that supports variable braking. The current ESC is a 36V esc with a maximum current rating of 12A. With a different ESC, variable braking and acceleration can be programmed into percent throttle values and can also support multiple motors.</p>

        <p> <i>Motor</i> </br>Another key decision in the planning process was choosing between a brushless belt-driven motor and a hubless motor. The hubless motor has its motors built into the trucks, while the belt-driven motors use an external gear system and belt drives to push the board. While the hubless motors create a clean minimalistic aesthetic, I opted for a belt-driven motor because it makes the board more customizable and also easier to service if the motor fails. The current motor installed in the board is a 270kv brushless motor which uses 12-24V depending on ESC input. The motor has a power output of 1800W maximum. It is connected to the longboard trucks using a custom fitted mount and uses belts to drive the wheels of the skateboard.</p>
