            <p>Welcome! My name is Khoi Nguyen. Currently, I am a first-year electrical engineer at Cal Poly Pomona. I'm located in the Pomona and Orange county regions, but am open to relocation. I love coding and building things and I hope to work in the software side of E.E. in the future. Besides major specific hobbies, I love skateboarding and watching racing series like F1, WEC, and MotoGP.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am a member in IEEE and a regenerative braking team member in the Cal Poly Pomona Formula SAE Electric team. I always love working on new things, so if you have a cool idea for a project or want to get in touch with me, contact me here.</p>

          <div class="highlight3"><h2>L3 IEC</h2></div>
            <p>In the summer of 2018, I interned at L3 IEC in Anaheim, CA. During the four week period, I was an electrical engineering intern in the test engineering department. Under the guidance of my manager, I used VBA to automate the employee auditing system and led a Vex robotic team. The robot moved using treads and manipulated objects using a crane that could be lowered and raised. It used ultrasonic distance sensors to navigate the course and used color sensors in order to complete the Vex courses tasks. On this team, I coded the automatic course traversal and the created the locking mechanism for grasping objects on the course.</p>

            <p>In addition to the robot. I learned the basics of radio frequencies, GPS triangulation and the atomic clocks that limit the precision of these devices. I studied signal wave and carrier wave modulation and the the methods for determining the time and distance differences between the GPS constellation and the radio device. I also learned basic RF blocking, in which noise is used to block / deflect radio signals that are meant to detect objects, or send signals to said objects.</p>
