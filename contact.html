          <p> Open Letter to Employers, </p>
          <p>In high school, I interned for a defense contractor and it quickly became my dream to further my career in saving lives, both American and foreign. I am very interested in the defense, medicine, and energy industries because these companies are leaders in global technology and have a focus on creating a more sustainable world. I would love to bring my background of GPS, radio frequency and software knowledge to engineering teams. </p>
          <p>In addition to my experience with circuitry, I am also experienced in coding. I am knowledgeable in C++, Python and Java, in addition to web development languages such as html and css. I've created multiple websites and enjoy pushing myself to create faster, more responsive webpages. I also possess leadership qualities and am able to manage teams of individuals by working with my teammates instead of above them. These responsibilities that I've experienced range from the planning and budgeting of a project to the designing and implementation of concepts into the final product.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I am looking for an internship in the Spring and Summer of 2020 so I could expand my knowledge of hardware and software design. Because I am still so early in my career, I've yet to figure out which concept of electrical engineering I want to focus on. Hopefully through internship oppurtunities, I will be able to narrow down my engineering interests and further solidify my interest in electrical engineering aspects. Most importantly, I want hands-on experience and join a team that is as passionate about engineering as I am. Whether it be technology designed to fight wars, or medical equipment meant to aid doctors, I want to work on exciting new technology with the capabilities of saving lives.</p>
          <p>Thank you, <br> Khoi Nguyen </p>
